ChatGPT said:
Here is a minimal Streamlit app for your use case:

âœ… Features:

Input field for search query

Search button

Output field to display results

import streamlit as st

# Title of your app
st.title("Simple Database Search Interface")

# Input field
search_query = st.text_input("Enter your search keyword:")

# Search button
if st.button("Search"):
    # Placeholder for actual database search logic
    # For example, you will call your database function here
    # result = search_database(search_query)
    
    # Dummy result for illustration
    result = f"You searched for: {search_query}"
    
    # Output field
    st.write("### Search Result:")
    st.write(result)
âš¡ How to run
Save this as app.py

In terminal, activate your environment if needed, then run:

streamlit run app.py
The browser will open with your interface.

ðŸ”— Next steps
To integrate with your database:

Replace the dummy result with your actual query logic, for example using cx_Oracle or sqlalchemy for Oracle SQL.

Ensure you manage database connections efficiently (singleton pattern or session-based within Streamlit).

If you want, I can assist you in integrating this with your existing Oracle search script, or building a reusable function with your credentials and SQL queries. Let me know your next focus today.
